The **AI-Powered Global Sales Analytics Dashboard** is a comprehensive business intelligence solution developed using Power BI. It provides a clear, interactive, and strategic view of global sales performance from 2023 to 2024. The dashboard helps stakeholders track key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze regional sales patterns, monitor customer behavior, and uncover actionable insights to improve business growth and profitability.

This project demonstrates the effective use of data cleaning, DAX calculations, and visualization techniques to transform raw sales data into a powerful decision-support system.
